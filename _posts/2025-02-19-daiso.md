Keeping today's post super short because I have to study for a test. Went to Daiso yesterday to pick up some moving supplies, and found these:

Everything in Daiso is Â¥100 (66 cents) unless otherwise stated, and the quality is actually so good. I couldn't help myself from buying cool nicknacks and fancy tools, and the total was just $7 at the end. The packing tape actually worked as advertised (hand-rippable packing tape and tape that is very quiet as you unroll it). It felt so Japanese, yet honestly, I would totally buy these in America too if they were available.

Another fun fact, I was looking for cardboard boxes to pack my stuff in, and grocery stores often have a section out front where they put a bunch of free spare cardboard boxes for you to grab, mostly to help carry groceries out I guess, but they did not care when I snagged 5 of them for moving purposes. So, another pretty awesome thing.

Anyways apparently there's a bug with my website and the post I spent so long on did not actually display. Hopefully it'll work now, but I swear I wrote and uploaded it yesterday...
