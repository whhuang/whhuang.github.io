Woke up at 4 am today (after going to bed at 1…) to catch the 6 am Shinkansen (bullet train) to Nagano. Why? To go skiing! Well, I’m trying to cram as much skiing as I can this weekend so I’ll probably keep these posts relatively short and do a big one at the end.

Today's itinerary:
- 4:30 - wake up
- 5:00 - leave house with ski bag to go to subway
- 5:45 - arrive at Tokyo station, have awkward conversation with train agent because I did something weird with my Shinkansen ticket booking
- 6:15 - get on Shinkansen, depart
- 7:30 - arrive at Nagano, buy bus ticket
- 8:15 - get on bus from Nagano to Hakuba
- 9:30 - arrive at Hakuba, take bus to accommodation
- 10:15 - arrive at accommodation (specifically, a [pension](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2025_pension.html) called [Nugget Inn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XhWN8m8eowc7e6Gu5), it's super cute). Get changed
- 11:00 - leave the inn, walk to ski resort
- 11:30 - grab lunch
- 12:00 - arrive at ski resort (I went to [Happo One](https://www.hakubavalley.com/en/weather_en/detail_happo_en/) but there are like a dozen resorts in Hakuba), buy half day lift ticket (noon-4pm). Learn how to snowboard again
- 16:00 - leave resort
- 16:30 - buy burnt sweet potato, talk to some travelers
- 17:30 - arrive back at inn completely frozen
- 19:00 - get dinner with friends
- 21:00 - go to sleep
