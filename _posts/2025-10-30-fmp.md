The Triathlon in Tokyo (TnT) club has a Friday morning practice known as "Friday Morning Pain (FMP)". It consists of bike hill repeats (going up and down a steep hill), then running a 5 or 10K around Imperial Palace, a very popular spot for running (one lap around the palace is exactly 5K, and it's completely uninterrupted). Apparently, biking and then immediately running after is called a "brick", because your legs supposedly feel like bricks (don't fact-check me on that one), and it's something you have to specifically practice for triathlons. I thought the "pain" in FMP was because the workout sucked, but it's actually because it starts at 6am. I failed to get a good night's sleep and had to wake up at 5 since it takes 40 min to bike to practice. I'm literally falling asleep as I'm writing this post so...zzzz
