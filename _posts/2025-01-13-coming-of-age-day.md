Ah, I'm so late to today's post! Today was [Coming of Age Day (Seijin no Hi, 成人の日)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_Age_Day), a national holiday in Japan celebrating people coming to adulthood, which means another day of skiing for me :)

It was dumping this morning - my first true Japow (Japan powder) experience. It was pretty sweet.

We had a long drive back to Tokyo and I got home around midnight. We stopped by [Kawanakajima Onsen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qVLTufx2vcWaJNkV7) in Nagano on the way back, a [Super Sento](http://www.unmissabletokyo.com/super-sento). Reminded me a bit of a hybrid between an onsen and a Korean spa, it was huge, had different kinds of baths with some fun features like an ultrasonic massager (it kind of felt like getting tased very gently underwater...) and a salt sauna where you rub salt all over your body and sit in a sauna (you figure out where all your small cuts and scraped on your body are really quickly. Literally adding salt to your wounds). It doesn't seem like a raving review so far but it was honestly so cool. There was an indoor and outdoor section, outdoor was kind of cold but the indoor onsen was 43C, which Angela guessed correctly on the first try. I'll go into more details later!
