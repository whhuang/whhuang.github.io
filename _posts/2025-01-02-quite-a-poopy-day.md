Started off the day going to the Ramen Museum in Shin-Yokohama. Sometimes specialty museums are kind of gimmicky or feel more like a tourist trap than interesting education about the subject matter, but I was pretty impressed by the Ramen Museum. There was a decent amount of history, but I wish there was a bit more culinary information about the different styles of ramen. Not only do you get to read about ramen, but the museum invites ramen vendors from all over the country to run a small shop inside the museum, so it's a true interactive museum. The lines to get a bowl of ramen are pretty long, and also I kind of wish the portions were smaller so you could sample more (it is nice that it feels more like you're eating at the restaurant than sampling food at a museum), but after two bowls we were completely stuffed.

- *one of the ramen shops we ate at - they revived the first ever ramen shop founded in 1910, called [Rairaiken](https://ramenadventures.com/listing/%E6%B7%BA%E8%8D%89-%E4%BE%86%E3%80%85%E8%BB%92-rairaiken-at-the-shin-yokohama-ramen-museum/)*

It was honestly so cool and would highly recommend visiting. I would post more (and higher quality) photos but I'd really encourage people to come see for themselves!

Afterwards, we walked around Shin-Yokohama and saw Nissan Stadium (at least, the outside of it).

_played a quick round of hacky sack next to the stadium_

As we were leaving, I had to ðŸ’© really badly. Luckily there are public toilets everywhere, and they are really well kept, so even in the middle of a park I was able to complete my task. But also, uh, maybe be a little cautious at the Ramen Museum. As we were returning back to the subway station, a giant flock of birds decided to fly overhead.

It was really cool to watch, but one of them decided to leave Miles a little present...

So moral of the story...the most dangerous things in Japan are ramen and birds?

(Sorry if the videos aren't working, I'm working on it)
