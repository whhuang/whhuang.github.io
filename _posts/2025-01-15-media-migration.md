New life post coming up soon, however as I mentioned at the end of my last post, I hit my free git-lfs limit (it was pretty low) which means I needed to find a new media solution in order to upload more videos. I asked good ol' ChatGPT for help, and it recommended Cloudflare R2 (storage) + Cloudflare CDN (Content Delivery Network to decrease bandwidth usage). Was pretty easy to set up (~1 hr for bad-at-following-instructions noob like me), and it seems to be free as long as I don't exceed the R2 storage/bandwidth limits, but if I do, I think it'll be pretty cheap so I hopefully won't be hit with a massive bill one day. Probably should've started with this, but it's all good, the migration was also super easy.

What does this mean? More performant media loading, longer videos, and better quality photos coming your way soon!
