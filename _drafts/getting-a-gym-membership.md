How hard could getting a gym membership be? It's not really, but let's work backwards on what it takes to do _anything_ in Japan immediately after moving here.

I tried registering for a gym membership at [this place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f6k5dKPXne5k2dT56) (seemed reasonable and is very close to me). The website is entirely in Japanese and is just a bunch of photos with text on it, so the webpage translate feature was useless. I had to take a bunch of screenshots of the website and put it in Google Translate's photo translate feature. Eventually I figured out that in order to sign up, you have to "friend" the gym on [Line](https://www.line.me/en/), a messaging app commonly used in Japan.

So I downloaded Line and tried to follow a bunch of instructions in Japanese to register a membership.
