I'm philosophically opposed to social media, though I'm far from immune from succumbing to its poisons. I don't use Instagram, which would've probably been a way better home for the content of this blog (at least, in terms of viewership), and I think people who do things so they can get a cool photo out of it are a little ridiculous. That being said, I recently bought the [Meta Ray Bans](https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/), possibly the last thing I thought I would do once upon a time.
