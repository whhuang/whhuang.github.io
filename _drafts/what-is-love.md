I was going back and forth about whether to post about this topic because I'm not sure who my audience is yet. Oddly enough, I'd feel less weird if it were just strangers reading this, but it seems a little too intimate for acquaintances and colleagues. However, I think love is a nearly universal human experience, and I think being honest (as long as you are also compassionate) is generally well-received, so I might as well try.

I've asked myself this question constantly throughout my life. And of course, everyone has a different definition, but I think that has ended up confusing me more. Perhaps the best way to answer this question is to start with, what is love not?

- Love is not butterflies in your stomach when your crush walks in the room
- Love is not your partner bringing you an omelette in bed on a Sunday morning
- Love is not the exhilarating touch of a new person

It's easy to be happy in a moment designed to be happy. Not saying that if you are in a happy, lovely moment, you aren't in love - but those aren't where love shines. Love is the soft candlelight glow when the lights go out. When the lights are on, you can't see it, but when you need it the most, it's there for you. It's trust that you've built for someone else based on your belief of who they are.
