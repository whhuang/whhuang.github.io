Japanese people are obsessed with sakura (cherry blossoms). Tourists, of course, are also obsessed. I personally find overhyped things a bit unattractive - most things start out with a modest amount of interest and appreciation, but as people discover it and make idealized social media posts about it, people's perception also becomes more idealized, creating a snowball effect that ends up in a disproportionate amount of enthusiasm for something, which can often leave people disappointed when they experience it themselves finally.

This was my first time experiencing sakura season, and really even seeing any sakura bloom at all.
