So, I've come across my next technical challenge with setting up this blog - how do I want to upload/host and present media, such as images and videos? Visual elements are more engaging than purely text-based ones, as many social media companies have figured out, so it seems worthwhile to emulate existing successful patterns than to reinvent the wheel. I think it would be really cool to have a page that displays all the media that has been uploaded to the website (or bonus - for each category landing page) in a gallery format, and when you click on the image or video, it will display a link to go to the blog post where that media was originally posted on. But to tackle the basics first - I need a good media hosting solution.

Option 1:
Upload smaller files (such as images) to the Github repo, and upload videos to Youtube.

Option 2:
Upload all media files to one, likely cloud-hosted, web-accessible centralized location and embed the URLs in the website.

Option 3:
Use a CDN?
