I meant to talk about this last week (er, now two weeks ago as of publishing this) but I didn’t get around to writing a post. I met someone (Amy) through a Facebook group for women foreigners living in Tokyo, and we started chatting a few weeks ago. I mentioned that I wanted to try climbing in Tokyo, and she was down too. We met up for the first time last Friday, and I brought a friend (Rui) I had met at a party 2 Sundays ago (yet another post I haven’t written yet, Rui is actually a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend in theory, but now just 1-degree friend :) ), and Amy brought someone she had also met through the Facebook group, Kirsten. We decided to go to [NOBOROCK](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hrSh89y19YRaJDEV7) in Shibuya (it’s the closest climbing gym to my school, and it offers a discount to women which is kind of weird, but since we were 4 women, we certainly weren’t complaining).

I used to go to Benchmark and Dogpatch in San Francisco, and a few things I noticed about Noborock (that perhaps applies to other Tokyo/Japanese climbing gyms as well): 1. the rating system is pretty different: they use colors, and I’ve heard the colors aren’t necessarily consistent between gyms, 2. the walls are a lot shorter, 3. there are a lot more beginner climbs (and even the higher-rated climbs have a very gentle progression). I was actually kind of nervous to go climbing in Japan because I’m quite a beginner (still at V1-V2’s), and I’ve heard that Japan has some of the world’s best climbers and are really insane. I was sure I was going to be greatly outclassed at the gym. So the fact that it seemed much more approachable was a very pleasant and welcome surprise, and I really wish SF gyms had more beginner-friendly and shorter climbs (specifically, in the height dimension because I am quite terrified of heights, but shorter in the length/time dimension is great too because it means you have much more stamina to try more climbs).

It was a pretty big ego boost climbing at Noborock because they were quite generous with their ratings. I’m pretty sure I still haven’t done anything harder than a V2, but according to their ratings chart, I had finished climbs that are equivalent to V3-V4, which I know wouldn’t have been rated that in the SF gyms (but shhh, no one has to know). The 4 of us all had different levels of climbing experience and skill, but I think that’s the nice thing about climbing - routes of different levels are all bunched together, so you don’t need to segregate by skill level (versus say, skiing). And on top of that, there’s pretty low risk to trying out harder stuff - seeing other people do it can often give you the confidence to try something you normally wouldn’t have even looked at.

Anyways, we decided to meet up again and climb today (then grab dinner together afterwards), so, I think we’ve more or less established a weekly hangout which I’m super excited about!

Last week when we grabbed dinner, we went to [27MCM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FVgyJsNGYYu5zuQb7) which is a [monjayaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monjayaki)/[okonomiyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki) restaurant. Monjayaki is

For dinner, we went to [Reism Stand](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AuTvQDWykMLkncyZ9?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy)
